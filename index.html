            <hr class="divider">
            <p>Hi! I'm Laurel.  I'm a developer who recently transplanted to Tucson, Arizona from a small town
                in Kansas.  I consider myself fortunate to be making a living doing what I love - building cool stuff
                and teaching others how to build cool stuff.  Not many people get to find a career doing what they
                would otherwise do for fun, so I count my blessings.  
                My interests include all things web, Android dev, UI design, and the .NET world.
                I also love teaching and mentoring and spend my free time volunteering at programming clubs to 
                help others get into the best career in the world.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>I build custom templates for clients in the travel/tourism industry for use with our properitary
                Simpleview Content Management System.
                I also contribute bug fixes and new features to our "base client" - the starting point that we use
                to create new client websites.  I teach and mentor junior developers who are newer to programming.  I've also
                given a tech talk on Git to assist our developers transitioning from SVN.
            </p>
            <p>
                Technologies that I use at work include: Javascript, HTML5, CSS3, Handlebars templating (in-house variant),
                Vue.js, and MongoDB.

            <p>I worked at Lafene Health Center for two years while I was completing my Bachelor of Computer Science
                degree.  I created Power BI data visualizations using data from the MSSQL database of the Electronic Medical Record (EMR).
                I also created custom design work for print and web media.  I created a Power BI report for the 
                College Allocations Committee to visually represent the improvements that the health center had made with their
                funding.  This presentation given by the director of LHC resulted in a 1.5% year over year increase in funding for the 
                next three years.  Due to excellence in this role, I was nominated by my supervisors for the 2018 Kyle Penton Student of the Year Award.

            <p>I worked as a teaching assistant for the Computer Science department at Kansas State University (KSU) while
                working on my degree.  I assisted with three courses: Intro to Computer Science, where first-year students 
                learned Python and programming fundamentals; C Programming Lab; and Data Structures, where students learned 
                data structures concepts in C#.

            <p>I was a Software Engineering Intern at Softek Solutions during Summer 2018.  In this internship, I 
                developed enhancements for Panther, a .NET desktop application that optimizes the Cerner Millenium Electronic
                Medical Record system.  I rewrote an existing component to use WPF instead of WinForms and to use the
                Model-View-ViewModel architecture.  I also created a client-side filter to allow users to query an audit list
                of actions performed in the EMR.  I utilized Test-Driven Development and wrote unit tests for all my code using the 
                NUnit framework.

            <p>Before I became a developer, I was a Registered Nurse for four years at Via Christi Hospital.  I worked on the 
                Medical Unit from July 2013 to February 2015 and then transferred to the Endoscopy Lab.  I served as a charge nurse
                on the Medical Unit on an as-needed basis, supervising a team of 3-5 nurses and 1-2 nursing assistants during my shift.
                I also served as the full-time charge nurse for the Endoscopy Lab from May 2016 to June 2017.  I managed staffing and shift
                assignments for 4 nurses and 3 scrub technicians, communicated with vendors on technical difficulties, and coordinated with 
                with physicians and anesthesia providers.  I also cross-trained to the Post-Anesthesia Care Department and assisted with their off-hours 
                call.  I also cross-trained to the Outpatient Surgery department and Wamego Hospital Outpatient surgery departments and assisted 
                them on an as-needed basis. I served as a Super User during the hospital's transition to Computerized Physician Order Entry and 
                collaborated with the IT department to create several EMR improvements to our order entry software.  Finally, I was a leader
                in mentoring new nurses and oriented six new hires.
